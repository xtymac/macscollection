    'Aimily is a SMART goal-setting app that allows users to break down one task into multiple steps. It reminds users to follow the SMART goal principles (meaning specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound) throughout the task breakdown process. I am currently working as a front-end designer in Team Aimily. My teammate and I have implemented a goal view screen that visually displays the progress of task completion. I am also in charge of the App Store and Play Store designs for the App as well as the upcoming blog page for Aimily web application.',
