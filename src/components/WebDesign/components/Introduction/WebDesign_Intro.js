        Mac's Collection is a Front-End Portfolio based on React.js, Scss, and
        AWS. It has a responsive, mobile-friendly, and original design built
        from scratch. This portfolio demonstrates my projects from 2020 to 2021.
        The motif is to encourage people from the global pandemic and practice
        my user experience design and front-end development skills.
