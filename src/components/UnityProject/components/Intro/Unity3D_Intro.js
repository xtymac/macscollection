        MLB101 is a Unity project made for baseball training purposes. It
        contains various animated characters demonstrating basic movements. By
        having 3D players placed in a virtual baseball field, users can view the
        demonstration in 360 degrees and follow their movements at the same
        time; the mirror function is capable of providing real-time feedback
        towards their positions. This is a project under the instruction of the
        NYU certificated program, and it is still in the conceptual phase.
