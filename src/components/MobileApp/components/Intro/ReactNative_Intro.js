          Aimily is a SMART goal-setting App. It allows users to break down one
          task into multiple steps. It reminds users to follow the SMART goal
          principle that is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and
          time-bound throughout the task breakdown process. I am working as a
          front-end designer in Team Aimily. My teammate and I have implemented
          a goal view screen that displays the progress of task completion
          visually. I am also in charge of the App Store and Play Store designs
          for the App and the upcoming blog page for Aimily's web application.
