          Aimily is a SMART goal-setting app that allows users to break down one
          task into multiple steps. It reminds users to follow the SMART goal
          principles (meaning specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and
          time-bound) throughout the task breakdown process. I am currently
          working as a front-end designer in Team Aimily. My teammate and I have
          implemented a goal view screen that visually displays the progress of
          task completion. I am also in charge of the App Store and Play Store
          designs for the App as well as the upcoming blog page for Aimily's web
          application.
